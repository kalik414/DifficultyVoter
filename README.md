# DifficultyVoter
A Bukkit plugin that can change server difficulty by your players votes without operator in-game or in console.

## Why?
Imagine: you're now playing on Minecraft sever with casual non-hardcore players, whoose dont like any difficult play. Once you want get a cool raid with a lot of totems to get, but on easy difficulty you won't get any cool reward. That's why I created this.

## Usage
/dv <easy | normal | hard> - starts vote for everyone, will end in 30 seconds;
/dv vote <yes | no> - command to vote, only works when there's active voting;
/dv forcestop - stops voting, only available for administrator

## Permissions:
dv.*
dv.bypasscooldown
dv.forcestop
